# Sublime InsertUnicode

This module allows to find and insert Unicode characters by their name.

## HOWTO

Basic:

- Run `InsertUnicode: (Block list)` to view the list of all Unicode blocks.
- Select a block to view its contents.
- Select a code point from the list to insert it under the cursor.

Still basic, but more comfy:

- Run "InsertUnicode: General punctuation" or another to directly jump into the given block.
- Open the `InsertUnicode.sublime-settings` file to change user defined character list.
- Run `InsertUnicode: (User list)` to insert one of this characters.

Use Sublime Text's fuzzy matching to find interesting symbols in the lists.

## Status

1.0-ish. Appears to work nice.
